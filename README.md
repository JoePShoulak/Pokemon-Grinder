#### Thanks

Thanks to kidGodzilla for all his work on this project. Below are his thanks as well. 

Thanks to https://github.com/bertrandom/snowball-thrower for the updated information which modifies the original script to throw snowballs in Zelda. This C Source is much easier to start from, and has a nice object interface for creating new command sequences.

Thanks to Shiny Quagsire for his [Splatoon post printer](https://github.com/shinyquagsire23/Switch-Fightstick) and progmem for his [original discovery](https://github.com/progmem/Switch-Fightstick).

Thanks to [exsilium](https://github.com/bertrandom/snowball-thrower/pull/1) for improving the command structure, optimizing the waiting times, and handling the failure scenarios. It can now run indefinitely!
